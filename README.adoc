= Jackson Bean Validation Module
:version: 0.5.0

This is a https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] extension to perform
https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/[Java Bean Validation] during deserialization.

== The Problem

This module is aimed mostly at REST APIs that should validate incoming JSON request
bodies, but it may be useful in other scenarios.

Imagine the following JSON request body:

[source,json]
----
{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "dateOfBirth": "1983-01-25"
}
----

In application code, This might be mapped to the following Java class with Jackson
and validation constraints:

[source,java]
----
public class PersonRequest {

    @NotEmpty
    String firstName;

    @NotEmpty
    String lastName;

    @Past
    LocalDate dateOfBirth; // requires JavaTimeModule

    // Getters and setters omitted
}
----

This works in the success case, but there could be a number of things that are wrong
about the request (assuming that it is syntactically correct JSON):

* Any of the properties might be missing.
* Any of the properties might have a wrong type in JSON (e.g. a `boolean`)
* The `dateOfBirth` might be in a format that is not parseable to a `LocalDate`.
* Any of the validation constraints might be violated.

All of these cases are typically handled by sending a `400 Bad Request` response back to the client,
ideally with a description of _all_ that was wrong with the request. This is especially important if such
errors should be displayed on a form in a UI.

In application code, this is most often handled with a two-step process:

. Deserialize the JSON payload into the Java object.
. Run the Bean `Validator` on it to find any constraint violations.

The big problem is that if step 1 fails (for example because `dateOfBirth` was not parseable to a `LocalDate`),
Jackson will throw an exception, and the response will only contain that single error information. Also, from the
Jackson exception it can be hard to pinpoint the exact property in the request that had a bad value. The client
will have to fix that one error and try again, only to find out that there are more errors that had not been reported
earlier.

For example, with the following request:

[source,json]
----
{
    "firstName": "",
    "dateOfBirth": "01-25"
}
----

This should ideally return a `400 Bad Request` response informing about 3 violations (`firstName` must not be empty,
`lastName` is missing, and `dateOfBirth` has a wrong format). However, since Jackson throws a `MismatchedInputException`
on parsing the `dateOfBirth`, the client won't even get to see the `firstName` and `lastName` violations until they try
again with a correct `dateOfBirth`.

Obviously, the only solution to this is to merge steps 1 and 2 into one, and perform the validation immediately
_during_ deserialization. This is where this module comes in.


== Usage

The module library is available on https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter[JCenter].

Add the following dependency to your build script:

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
.Gradle (build.gradle)
----
implementation 'org.unbroken-dome.jackson-bean-validation:jackson-bean-validation:{version}'
----

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
.Maven (pom.xml)
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.unbroken-dome.jackson-bean-validation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-bean-validation</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

In Java code, register an instance `BeanValidationModule` with your `ObjectMapper`. It also
requires a `ValidatorFactory` instance for performing validation. (For example,
http://hibernate.org/validator/[Hibernate Validator] is a widespread implementation of Bean Validation).

[source,java]
----

ValidatorFactory validatorFactory = Validation.byDefaultProvider()
    .configure()
    .buildValidatorFactory();

BeanValidationModule module = new BeanValidationModule(validatorFactory);

ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper()
    .registerModule(module);
----


Annotate all classes that should be validated with `@JsonValidated`. If this annotation is not
present, no validation will be performed.

[source,java]
----
@JsonValidated
public class PersonRequest {

    @NotEmpty
    String firstName;

    @NotEmpty
    String lastName;

    @Past
    LocalDate dateOfBirth;

    // Getters and setters omitted
}
----

To cascade the bean validation to nested beans, you can also annotate the property or constructor parameter
with `@Valid`.

[source,java]
----
@JsonValidated
public class PersonRequest {

    static class Name {
        @NotEmpty String firstName;
        @NotEmpty String lastName;
    }

    @Valid Name name;
}
----


== Handling Violations

Deserialization of this object, with the `BeanValidationModule` activated, might now throw a
`ConstraintViolationException` that contains _all_ the violations of the input document, including JSON
deserialization issues as well as constraint violations.


[NOTE]
.Property Paths
====
All property paths in the `ConstraintViolation` objects refer to the property names in the input JSON, _not_
the Java bean property names. They might be different if you use `@JsonNaming` with a custom name mapping strategy,
or `@JsonProperty` with explicit names.

The reason for this is that we're conceptually validating the JSON object and not the Java bean (which is just being
constructed).
====


To deal with errors that would otherwise result in exceptions thrown by Jackson, the module introduces two "pseudo"
constraints that are used for reporting these as constraint violations (even if they are not placed on the properties).


=== `JsonValidInput`

The module introduces a pseudo-constraint `JsonValidInput` that will be reported as violated whenever Jackson
would otherwise throw a `MismatchedInputException`.

In the above examples, a value for `dateOfBirth` that cannot be parsed to a `LocalDate` would be reported as a
violation of the `JsonValidInput` constraint, including the path to that property.

You can also place `@JsonValidValue` directly on a property in case you want a customized validation message:

[source,java]
----
@JsonValidValue(message = "Please enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD")
@Past
LocalDate dateOfBirth;
----

Note that `@JsonValidValue` is not an actual constraint annotation (it is not meta-annotated with `@Constraint`);
placing it on a property is only for customization of the constraint parameters.


=== `JsonRequired`

The second pseudo-constraint is `JsonRequired`; it is violated if there are any _missing_ properties that
are marked as required using the `@JsonProperty` annotation:

[source,java]
----
public class PersonRequest {

    @JsonCreator
    public PersonRequest(
        @JsonProperty(value="firstName", required=true) String firstName
        @JsonProperty(value="lastName", required=true) String lastName,
        @JsonProperty(value="dateOfBirth") LocalDate dateOfBirth) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

In this example, if `firstName` and/or `lastName` are missing in the input, they would be reported as a violation
to `JsonRequired`.

NOTE: `JsonRequired` violations are not triggered if the value is present in the JSON input but explicitly set to
`null`. Use the standard `@NotNull` constraint to catch this case.

Again, you could place `@JsonRequired` directly on a property; this has the same effect as
`@JsonProperty(required = true)` but also allows you to customize the validation message.


=== Customizing Validation Messages

For `JsonValidInput` and `JsonRequired`, there are three ways to provide validation messages (in order of precedence):

* *Property level*: Put the annotation directly on the validated property, and set its `message` argument
  (as described above).

* *Class level*: Set the `validInputMessage` or `requiredMessage` on the `@JsonValidated` annotation:
+
[source,java]
----
@JsonValidated(
    validInputMessage="is not valid",
    requiredMessage="is required")
public class PersonRequest {
    // ...
}
----

* *Global level*: Put the messages in your `ValidationMessages.properties` (or locale-specific variants):
+
[source,java-properties]
.ValidationMessages.properties
----
org.unbrokendome.jackson.beanvalidation.JsonValidInput.message=is not valid
org.unbrokendome.jackson.beanvalidation.JsonRequired.message=is required
----
+
Note that the global messages should _always_ be configured; the module library cannot provide defaults because
there cannot be a second `ValidationMessages.properties` on the classpath.


=== Cross-Parameter Validation with `@AssertTrue`

`@AssertTrue` constraints on instance methods are a common pattern with Bean Validation to perform cross-parameter
validation. With the bean validation module, this may not work as intended because the properties are validated
independently as they are deserialized, and the bean will not even be constructed if any of the property values
violates the constraints.

To enable evaluation of an `@AssertTrue` constraint, enable the `BeanValidationFeature.VALIDATE_BEAN_AFTER_CONSTRUCTION`
feature flag, which will cause the bean to be validated as a whole after it is fully constructed. Even so, such a
violation will only be reported if the bean _can_ be constructed, so a violation may not be visible if there
are other violations on creator properties (i.e. constructor params).


== Kotlin Support

The module should work well with Kotlin, and together with the `KotlinModule` from `jackson-module-kotlin`.
I would recommend to always use `data` classes where all properties are initialized in the constructor.

It is especially useful to perform `NotNull` checks on constructor arguments that are _not_ nullable in Kotlin,
because the validation happens before the constructor is called:

[source,kotlin]
----
@JsonValidated
data class PersonRequest(
    @param:NotNull val firstName: String,
    @param:NotNull val lastName: String,
    @param:Past val dateOfBirth: LocalDate)
----

The validating deserializer will automatically detect nullability of constructor parameter types, and treat the
parameters with non-nullable types as if they had an implicit `@NotNull` annotation. So the following is equivalent
to the example above:

[source,kotlin]
----
@JsonValidated
data class PersonRequest(
    val firstName: String,
    val lastName: String,
    @param:Past val dateOfBirth: LocalDate)
----

So, you no longer need to use `String?` just to validate `@NotNull` and use those ugly double exclamation
marks everywhere.

[INFO]
====
Remember that annotations on `val` parameters in the constructor should be qualified with `@param:`. You can place
multiple constraints with the shorthand syntax e.g. `@param:[NotNull Size(min = 3)]`.
====

=== Handling of Required Parameters and Primitives

The standard `KotlinModule` automatically treats all constructor parameters as required if they are not marked as
nullable (e.g. `String` instead of `String?`). If such parameters are missing in the JSON input, a violation of
`JsonRequired` would be raised.

However, for primitive types this behavior only applies if the deserialization feature `FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES`
is enabled (it is disabled by default). Otherwise, `null` or missing values are mapped to the default value of the
type (e.g. `0` for integers) even if the type is not nullable.

I would recommend to enable `FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` when using Kotlin together with this module.


=== Late-init Properties

Kotlin's `lateinit var` properties are deserialized like other properties, and their values will be validated based on
the annotations on the property. In addition, `lateinit var` properties are treated as if they had an implicit
`NotNull` constraint, because they cannot have nullable or primitive types. An explicit `@NotNull` annotation will
still be honored if present (for example, to customize the validation message).

- If the input JSON contains an explicit `null` value for the property, it will always be considered a violation of
  the `NotNull` constraint.
- If the input JSON does not contain the property at all, it will be considered a violation of `NotNull` by default,
  but this behavior can be controlled with the `BeanValidationFeature.VALIDATE_KOTLIN_LATEINIT_VARS` feature flag.
  You may want to switch off this behavior if you intend to initialize the `lateinit var` properties programmatically
  after deserialization.


== Jackson Version Compatibility

The module requires Jackson 2.9.x or higher; it has been tested to be compatible with all 2.9.x versions up to 2.9.9.
It does not work with Jackson 2.8.x.


== Limitations and Considerations

* Jackson handles a plethora of corner-cases and custom annotations, and probably many of them are not working
  properly. The module _should_ work for the most common cases (vanilla beans or constructor properties). If you
  spot an error with one of the more obscure Jackson features, please consider filing an issue.

* Jackson views are currently not supported (they might just work, but lacking more extensive testing).

* Validation groups are currently not supported - mostly because there is no nice way of passing them to the
  `ObjectMapper` when deserializing.

* Bean validation does not allow parameter validation on static methods. That means that static `@JsonCreator` factory
  methods will only be checked for valid input and required parameters, but actual bean validation constraints on
  these parameters will not be evaluated.
